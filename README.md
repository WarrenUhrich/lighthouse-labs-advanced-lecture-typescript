# Lighthouse Labs | Advanced Lecture: TypeScript

* [ ] What is TypeScript?

## What is TypeScript?

* TypeScript was created by Microsoft
* First released to the public on October 1, 2012
* Free and open-source high-level programming language
* Intended to add static typing and optional type annotations to JavaScript code
* Considered a "superset" of JavaScript
    * This means that it is everything that JavaScript is, with additional optional bells and whistles
    * All JavaScript programs are syntactically valid TypeScript (but may type-checks when compiled)
* TypeScript code is compiled to JavaScript before running, making it a "transpiled" language
    * Transpilation is the idea that we write code in one language (TS), that is converted to another languge (JS), that must itself be executed or compiled
* The TypeScript compiler is written in TypeScript

## The Point of using TypeScript

TypeScript is meant to bring about numerous benefits when writing what would otherwise be JavaScript code.

* VSCode uses TypeScript when detecting errors and making suggestions in your programs already!
* This becomes more powerful and the suggestions become more useful/accurate when you write your code using TypeScript's features
* TypeScript helps document the code you write, and you'll find improved suggestions even when using functions and objects that you have written yourself
* TypeScript brings stronger "typing" to JavaScript; this is something that exists in many other languages, especially those that are compiled (think C, C++, C#, Rust, or Go)
